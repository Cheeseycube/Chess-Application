# Chess-Application
 This is going to be a chess application that automatically pulls a given user's games from chess.com and stores them on a database where they can be analyzed.
 Currently a basic user log-in system is implemented and you can pull games from Chess.com onto your profile. From there, you can view a table of all games currently stored.
 To test this, you can run web_app.py in the flask_application directory, but it will not function as intended since you need credentials to connect to my database.
 In the future, this will be a website hosted remotely instead of a local flask application which will solve this problem.
